Some users have reported an issue when using Badgeify alongside the Ice menu bar manager.

## The Issue

When using Ice to manage menu bar items, Badgeify icons may be automatically moved to the "Always Hidden" or "Hidden" section after:
- System restart
- Application restart
- Adding new icons dynamically

This behavior is particularly noticeable with dynamically appearing menu bar items, such as when Badgeify adds new notification badges or updates existing ones.

## Cause

This is a known issue with Ice's menu bar item management system, as documented in their [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/issues/344). The issue appears to stem from how Ice handles menu bar items that:

1. Appear after Ice has already started
2. Disappear and reappear dynamically
3. Update their state or appearance

Since Badgeify actively manages notification badges and updates icons based on application states, it can trigger this behavior in Ice.

## Current Status

This is a known limitation in Ice's current implementation, affecting not just Badgeify but also other applications with dynamic menu bar items, including:
- Discord voice channel controls
- Calendar apps with dynamic updates
- Applications with changing status indicators

## Workarounds

While there isn't a permanent solution yet, you have several options:

1. **Manual Repositioning:**
   - Manually drag Badgeify icons back to your preferred section after they move
   - Note that you may need to repeat this after system or application restarts

2. **Use Alternative Menu Bar Managers:**
   - Consider using [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) instead, which has better handling of dynamic menu bar items
   - Bartender remembers icon positions and handles dynamic updates more reliably

## Future Resolution

The Ice development team is aware of this issue and it may be addressed in future updates. You can:
- Follow the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/issues/344) for updates
- Consider contributing to the discussion with your specific use case
- Watch for new Ice releases that might improve dynamic item handling
