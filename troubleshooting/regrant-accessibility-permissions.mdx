title: "Re-granting Accessibility Permissions"
---

If Badgeify loses its Accessibility permissions (for example, after a macOS update or system changes), you may need to manually re-grant these permissions. Follow these steps to restore Badgeify's access.


Starting with **v1.9.4**, Badgeify's code signing certificate was updated from an individual Apple Developer account to an organization account. This change means:

- macOS treats the updated app as a different application
- All previously granted permissions (including Accessibility) need to be re-authorized
- This is a one-time process required only when upgrading from versions prior to v1.9.4

## Why Accessibility Permissions Are Needed

Badgeify requires Accessibility permissions to:

- Read notification counts from other applications
- Monitor app badge changes in real-time

Without these permissions, Badgeify cannot function properly.

## How to Re-grant Accessibility Permissions

### Step 1: Open System Settings

1. Click the **Apple menu** () in the top-left corner of your screen
2. Select **System Settings**

### Step 2: Navigate to Accessibility Settings

1. In System Settings, click on **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar
2. Scroll down and click on **Accessibility**

### Step 4: Quit Badgeify Completely

2. Select **Quit Badgeify**

2. You should see a system prompt asking for Accessibility permissions
3. Click **Open System Settings** in the prompt

### Step 6: Grant Accessibility Permissions

1. In the Accessibility settings window, find **Badgeify** in the list
2. Toggle the switch next to Badgeify to **ON**
3. You may be prompted to enter your Mac password or use Touch ID
4. Confirm the action

### Step 7: Verify Permissions

1. The toggle next to Badgeify should now be **ON** (blue)
2. Return to Badgeify and check if notification counts are displaying correctly

## Troubleshooting
