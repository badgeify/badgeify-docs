title: 'Deactivate a Device'
---

If you need to free up your Badgeify license activation slot (for example, if you've reached your device limit or are replacing a computer), you can deactivate a device using one of the following methods.

## Method 1: Deactivate from Within the App (Device Accessible)

If you still have access to the Mac where Badgeify is currently activated:

1.  Open the Badgeify **Preferences** window.
2.  Navigate to the **About** tab.
3.  Look for a button labeled "Deactivate".
4.  Click this button and confirm the deactivation.

This will remove the license activation from the current Mac.

## Method 2: Deactivate via License Management Portal (Device Inaccessible)

If you no longer have access to the activated Mac (e.g., it was lost, stolen, broken, or reformatted before you could deactivate):

1.  Go to the online **License Management portal**: [https://badgeify.app/license/](https://badgeify.app/license/)
2.  Enter the **Email** address associated with your purchase and your **License Key**.
3.  Click **Continue**.
4.  You should see a list of your currently activated devices.
5.  Find the device you want to remove and click the corresponding "Deactivate" button.

This allows you to manage your activations remotely.

## Using the License Key Again

Once a device has been successfully deactivated using either method, its activation slot is freed up. You can then use the same license key to activate Badgeify on a new Mac.
