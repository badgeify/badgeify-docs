Badgeify offers three distinct badge styles to display notification counts in your macOS menu bar, each designed for different privacy and visual preferences.

## Available Badge Styles

Badgeify provides three notification badge styles to match your workflow and aesthetic preferences:

- **Text Style**: Displays exact notification counts as numbers next to app icons
- **Dot Style**: Shows a simple dot indicator for notification presence without revealing counts
- **Circle Style**: iOS-style red circular badges with optional count display

### Text Style

The Text style shows precise notification numbers next to your app icons, providing the most detailed information at a glance.

- **Clear Information**: Displays actual notification numbers (e.g., "5", "12", "99\+")
- **Smart Positioning**: Numbers appear to the right of the app icon
- **Theme Adaptive**: Automatically adapts to light and dark menu bar themes
- **Privacy Control**: Can be completely hidden using the "Show Notification Count" setting

### Dot Style

The Dot style offers a minimalist approach, showing notification presence without revealing specific counts.

- **Simple Indicator**: Displays a single dot (â€¢) when notifications are present
- **Always Visible**: Remains visible when notifications exist, regardless of count display settings
- **Theme Aware**: Color adapts to your menu bar theme
- **Privacy First**: No count information displayed

### Circle Style

The Circle style mimics familiar iOS notification badges with distinctive red circles for maximum visual prominence.

- **iOS Familiar**: Red circular badge positioned at the top-right of the icon
- **Flexible Display**: Shows counts inside when "Show Notification Count" is enabled, or empty circles when disabled
- **Customizable**: Supports custom highlight colors
- **Count Limit**: Numbers capped at "99" for large counts

## Show Notification Count Setting

The "Show Notification Count" setting behaves differently based on your chosen badge style:

- **Text Style**: Enables/disables number display entirely
- **Dot Style**: Setting is automatically disabled - dots always appear when notifications exist
- **Circle Style**: Controls whether counts appear inside circles or shows empty circles

## How to Configure Badge Styles

**For Individual Apps:**

1. Right-click any app icon in your menu bar
2. Choose **Settings** from the context menu
