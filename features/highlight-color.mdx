## Why Customize Notification Colors?

*   **Improved Visibility**: Quickly identify which app or group has notifications just by the color.
*   **Personalization**: Choose colors that fit your workflow or aesthetic preferences.
*   **Better Organization**: Visually separate different types of apps (e.g., work vs. personal) in your menu bar.

## How to Set Custom Notification Colors

Setting up custom colors is straightforward:

1.  **Open Badgeify Preferences**: Launch Badgeify and open its Preferences window.
2.  **Select an App or Group**: In the list on the left, click on the specific app or App Group you wish to customize.
3.  **Choose Highlight Color**: Find the "Highlight Color" setting. Click the color swatch to open the color picker.
4.  **Pick Your Color**: Select the desired color for the notification badge when there are unread counts.
5.  **Apply**: The change takes effect immediately. The selected app or group's icon in the menu bar will now use this color for its notification badge background when notifications are present.

You can set distinct colors for individual applications or apply a single color to an entire App Group for consistent visual grouping. This flexibility allows you to tailor your menu bar notifications precisely to your needs.
