title: 'Customize Menu Bar Icons'
---

Badgeify allows you to personalize your macOS menu bar by using your own custom icons for the apps you add.

## Adding Custom SVG Icons

You can replace the default app icons displayed by Badgeify in the menu bar with your own designs using the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format.

### Key Features

*   **Use Your Own Designs**: Upload SVG icons you've created or downloaded.
*   **High-Quality Display**: SVGs ensure your icons look sharp at any resolution.
*   **Flexibility**: Easily change icons whenever you want a new look.

### Intelligent Icon Adaptation

Badgeify intelligently handles your custom icons:

*   **Monochrome Icons**: If you upload a single-color SVG icon, Badgeify automatically converts it into a macOS template icon. This means the icon will adapt to light mode, dark mode, and different menu bar background colors, ensuring visibility.
*   **Multicolor Icons**: If your SVG icon uses multiple colors, Badgeify preserves the original design, allowing vibrant icons to stand out in the menu bar.

## How to Add a Custom Icon

1.  **Get an SVG Icon**: Create your own SVG icon or download one. Ensure it's in the SVG format.
2.  **Select the App in Badgeify**: Open Badgeify's preferences and select the app whose icon you want to change.
3.  **Upload the Icon**: Look for the option to add a custom icon and upload your `.svg` file.
4.  **See the Change**: Your custom icon will immediately appear in the menu bar.
