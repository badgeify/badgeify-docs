Badgeify's App Groups feature allows you to organize multiple apps under a single icon in your macOS menu bar, reducing clutter and streamlining your workflow.

## What are App Groups?

App Groups let you combine several related applications added via Badgeify into one consolidated menu bar item. Instead of having individual icons for each app, you'll have a single group icon that represents them all.

## Key Features

*   **Consolidated Apps**: Group multiple apps (e.g., all messaging apps, all work apps) under one icon.
*   **Custom Group Icons**: Assign a unique icon to each App Group for easy identification. You can even use custom SVG icons.
*   **Aggregated Notifications**: The group icon displays the total unread notification count for all apps within that group.
*   **Easy Management**: Add or remove apps from groups easyily.

## How to Create and Use App Groups

There are two main ways to create an App Group:

**Method 1: Create Group First**

1.  **Start Creation**: In the Badgeify app list (Preferences window), click the folder icon (`<folder_icon>`).
2.  **Select Apps**: Choose the apps you want to include in the new group from the list presented.
3.  **Confirm**: Badgeify creates the group with your selected apps.

**Method 2: Select Apps First**

1.  **Select Existing Apps**: In the Badgeify app list, hold down the `Shift` key and click to select multiple existing app items you want to group.
2.  **Click Folder Icon**: With the apps selected, click the folder icon (`<folder_icon>`).
3.  **Group Created**: Badgeify moves the selected apps into a newly created group.

**After Creating the Group:**

4.  **Choose an Icon**: Pick a suitable icon for your new group from the available options or upload your own custom SVG icon.
5.  **Customize Settings**: Adjust display options and notification settings for the group as needed.
6.  **Organized Menu Bar**: Your new App Group will appear as a single, designated icon in the menu bar.

## Benefits of Using App Groups

*   **Cleaner Menu Bar**: Significantly reduces the number of icons in your menu bar.
*   **Improved Efficiency**: Access related apps and view their combined notification status quickly.
*   **Personalized Organization**: Structure your menu bar apps according to your specific workflow (e.g., by project, communication type).
*   **Better Overview**: Get an immediate sense of total notifications across related apps.

App Groups work seamlessly with other Badgeify features like custom icon support and drag-and-drop rearrangement.
