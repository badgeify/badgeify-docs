title: 'Control Icon Visibility'
---

Badgeify offers several options to control when and how app icons appear in your macOS menu bar, helping you reduce clutter and focus on what's important.

## Hiding Icons Based on Status

You can configure icons to automatically hide or become transparent based on the app's notification status or whether it's running.

*   **Hide Icon When No Notifications**: Found in the app's settings (often under an "Advanced" or display section), this option completely hides the app's icon from the menu bar when it has zero unread notifications. This is great for minimizing visual noise.
*   **Show Transparent Icon When No Notifications**: As an alternative to hiding completely, this option makes the icon semi-transparent when there are no notifications. This keeps the app accessible in the menu bar but visually de-emphasizes it.
*   **Show Transparent Icon When App Isn't Running**: For certain apps, you might only want to see the icon when the application is active. This setting makes the icon transparent if Badgeify detects the underlying application isn't running.

## Pinning Icons

The "Pin to menu bar" option allows you to designate specific app or group icons to *always* be visible in the menu bar. Pinned icons ignore global or individual hiding rules (like "Hide when no notifications"), ensuring your most important apps are always accessible at a glance.

## App-Specific Toggles

Some apps might have unique integration features with their own visibility controls.

*   **Slack Dot Indicator**: For Slack, Badgeify supports showing the red dot indicator for unread messages. You can toggle the visibility of this specific dot indicator in Slack's app settings within Badgeify.

By combining these options, you can fine-tune your menu bar to display exactly the icons you need, exactly when you need them.
